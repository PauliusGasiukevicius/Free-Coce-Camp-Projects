		<p>In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.
		<br>
		It does so by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime,
		starting with the first prime number, 2. 
		The multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence of numbers starting from that prime,
		with constant difference between them that is equal to that prime.
		This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number
		for divisibility by each prime.

		<p>Why we ussually need prime factors? Well it can be many things and exponentation is one of them.
		If we have array of primes up to &radic;N we can simply iterate over them to factorize any number up to N,
		Doing so we must check all primes up to &radic;N and it can be highly inefficient for larger numbers.
		<br>
		If we change our look-up table to show <b>smallest prime factor</b> instead of whether a number is prime or not,
		we can avoid looping throught all primes, and loop only throught primes that are actual factors of our number.

		<header>Segmented sieve</header>
		<p>So we know how to generate all primes in interval as large as our Memory can hold,
		but our memory could hold primes only (no look-up table) of much larger intervals, 
		for example there`s 50847534 primes below 1 billion which can still fit in memory of average PC yet look-up table of
		1 billion can`t.
		<br>
		To actually find all primes our memory can hold we need to construct so called "Segmented" sieve.
		The main idea to find all primes in interval [2,N] where N can be as high as we want (10^9 already takes ~2 minutes on average CPU),
		is to first find all primes up to &radic;N and then divide our large interval into smaller chunks that can fit into memory.
		Then in every chunk we can use sieve to mark multiples of each prime, and add remaining unmarked numbers to our prime array.

		<p>Sometimes we are not interested in primes themself but prime-related stuff like how many divisors a number has?
		We can also use sieve modification to efficiently solve this</p>

		<header>Eulers Totient Function</header>
		<p>Eulers Totient Function, called phi(x) calculates how many number are there in interval [1,x],
		such that their Greatest Common Divisor is 1. For single values for x there`s lots of formulas involving prime factors
		but what if we wanted to efficiently find all values of phi(x) in interval [1,N]?
		<br>
		Once again we can use modified sieve to find this.
